The Resume Submissions & Job Postings plugin will allow an admin to post jobs for their business. 


If the job is no longer active, it can be set to archive, and will no longer be shown on the listings page and widget.


When there are open jobs, users can go in and look at each one. They may also submit their resume for any job.
